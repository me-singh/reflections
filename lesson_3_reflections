When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-->to sync local work on pc with github repository so that others can see and make
  changes to it if required.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-->pulling manually makes you decide when to pull changes to the branche(or master) rather than
	pulling automatically which may lead to lots of unrequired commits and due to this
	debugging will not be easy.
