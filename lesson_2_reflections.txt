What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-->git is initilized in the repo with 0 commits.
	this need to be done to commit and save the history of the repo for easy debuging.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-->it is used to add different files(one or more) into the repository.
	act as a middle element for the repository and git repository(working directory).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
-->by using cmd git diff which checks for the changes b/w working directory and the staging area
	from where after confirming commit can be done.
