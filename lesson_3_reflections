When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
-->to sync local work on pc with github repository so that others can see and make
  changes to it if required.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-->pulling manually makes you decide when to pull changes to the branche(or master) rather than
	pulling automatically which may lead to lots of unrequired commits and due to this
	debugging will not be easy.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-->forks-To clone(copy) repository of someone into our github repository online(on github).
	clone-To clone(copy) repo of someone or yours(recommended) into your local host or pc.
	branches-To make changes to a project without affecting the master branch(main prototype).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
-->so that changes made in the github can be stored in that remote(origin/master) and
	 this makes merging and debugging the commits easily without internet access.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
-->using other version-control online.github collaboration will be easier as it is secured
	and easy to do whereas other vertion control may or may not be as easy and secured as github.
